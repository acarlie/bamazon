# About Bamazon

'Bamazon' is a CLI inventory management app created with Node.JS and MySQL. 'Bamazon' features customer, manager, and supervisor views. The customer view allows 'customers' to view available products and 'order' them. The manager view allows 'managers' to view products for sale, view low inventory, add inventory, and create products. The supervisor view allows 'supervisors' to view product sales by department and create departments.
