# About Bamazon

'Bamazon' is a CLI Node.JS app that updates and queries a MySQL database. The customer view allows 'customers' to view available products and 'order' them. The manager view allows 'managers' to view products for sale, view low inventory, add inventory, and create products. The supervisor view allows 'supervisors' to view product sales by department and create departments.
